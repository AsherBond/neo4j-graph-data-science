# Configuration parameters

The files in this folder contain details about configurations parameters.
They are meant to be used to partially generate documentation.

At this moment, only algorithm configurations are covered.

## How to

Run the `process_conf.py` script with `python process_conf.py`.
If there are no changes in the configuration files, running this script will have no effect. 
Check for any changes for example by running `git status`.

| nodeProperty | String | n/a | no | A node property corresponding to an array of floats used by K-Means to cluster nodes into communities.
| k | Integer | 10 | yes | Number of desired clusters.
| xref:common-usage/running-algos.adoc#common-configuration-max-iterations[maxIterations] | Integer | 10 | yes | The maximum number of iterations of K-Means to run.
| deltaThreshold | Float | 0.05 | yes | Value as a percentage to determine when to stop early. If fewer  than 'deltaThreshold * |nodes|'  nodes change their cluster , the algorithm stops. Value must be between 0 (exclusive) and 1 (inclusive).
| numberOfRestarts | Integer | 1 | yes | Number of times to execute K-Means with different initial centers. The communities returned are those minimizing the average node-center distances.
| randomSeed | Integer | n/a | yes | The seed value to control the initial centroid assignment.
| initialSampler | String | "uniform" | yes | The method used to sample the first k centroids. "uniform" and "kmeans++", both case-insensitive, are valid inputs.
| seedCentroids | List of List of Float | [] | yes | Parameter to explicitly give the initial centroids. It cannot be enabled together with a non-default value of the numberOfRestarts parameter.
| computeSilhouette | Boolean | false | yes | If set to true,  the silhouette scores are computed once the clustering has been determined. Silhouette is a metric on how well the nodes have been clustered.

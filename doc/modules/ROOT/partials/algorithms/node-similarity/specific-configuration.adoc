Values must be between 0 and 1.
| degreeCutoff                                                                     | Integer | 1       | yes      | Inclusive lower bound on the node degree for a node to be considered in the comparisons.
This value can not be lower than 1.

This value can not be lower than 1.

The K largest results are returned.
This value cannot be lower than 1.
| bottomK                                                                          | Integer | 10      | yes      | Limit on the number of scores per node.
The K smallest results are returned.
This value cannot be lower than 1.

The N largest total results are returned.
This value cannot be negative, a value of 0 means no global limit.
| bottomN                                                                          | Integer | 0       | yes      | Global limit on the number of scores computed.

This value cannot be negative, a value of 0 means no global limit.
| xref:common-usage/running-algos.adoc#common-configuration-relationship-weight-property[relationshipWeightProperty] | String  | null    | yes      | Name of the relationship property to use as weights.
If unspecified, the algorithm runs unweighted.
| similarityMetric
| String | JACCARD       | yes      |  The metric used to compute similarity.
Can be either `JACCARD`, `OVERLAP` or `COSINE`.
| [[runwcc-{instance}]] runWcc                                       | Boolean | false   | yes      | If enabled, an optimization which can increase performance for multi-component graphs is applied:  nodes in  distinct components always have a similarity of 0 and we can avoid comparing them.
As a pre-processing step xref:algorithms/wcc.adoc[WCC] is run to obtain the components.
| [[component-property-{instance}]] componentProperty                                         | String  | null    | yes      | If the components are available as a node property, they can be passed via this parameter rather than running WCC as discussed in the above  xref:#runwcc-{instance} [component optimization].

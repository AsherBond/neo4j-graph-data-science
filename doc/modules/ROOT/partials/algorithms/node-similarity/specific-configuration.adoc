Values must be between 0 and 1.
| degreeCutoff                                                                     | Integer | 1       | yes      | Inclusive lower bound on the node degree for a node to be considered in the comparisons.
This value can not be lower than 1.

The K largest results are returned.
This value cannot be lower than 1.

The N largest total results are returned.
This value cannot be negative, a value of 0 means no global limit.
| bottomN                                                                          | Integer | 0       | yes      | Global limit on the number of scores computed.

This value cannot be negative, a value of 0 means no global limit.
| xref:common-usage/running-algos.adoc#common-configuration-relationship-weight-property[relationshipWeightProperty] | String  | null    | yes      | Name of the relationship property to use as weights.
If unspecified, the algorithm runs unweighted.
| similarityMetric
| String | JACCARD       | yes      |  The metric used to compute similarity.
Can be either `JACCARD`, `OVERLAP` or `COSINE`.
| [[is-enable-component-optimization]] isEnableComponentOptimization               | Boolean | false   | yes      | If enabled applies an optimization which can increase performance for multi-component graphs. Makes use of the fact that nodes of distinct components always have a similarity of 0. If not already provided through xref:#component-property [componentProperty], internally runs xref:algorithms/wcc.adoc[WCC].

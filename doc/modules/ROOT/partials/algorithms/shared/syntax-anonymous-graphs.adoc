It is also possible to execute the algorithm on a graph that is projected in conjunction with the algorithm execution.
In this case, the graph does not have a name, and we call it anonymous.
When executing over an anonymous graph the configuration map contains a graph projection configuration as well as an algorithm configuration.
All execution modes support execution on anonymous graphs, although we only show syntax and mode-specific configuration for the `write` mode for brevity.

For more information on syntax variants, see xref::algorithms/syntax.adoc[Syntax overview].

| xref::common-usage/running-algos.adoc#common-configuration-concurrency[concurrency]            | Integer     | 4                      | yes      | The number of concurrent threads used for running the algorithm. Also provides the default value for 'readConcurrency' and 'writeConcurrency'.
| readConcurrency                                             | Integer     | value of 'concurrency' | yes      | The number of concurrent threads used for reading the graph.
| xref::common-usage/running-algos.adoc#common-configuration-write-concurrency[writeConcurrency] | Integer     | value of 'concurrency' | yes      | The number of concurrent threads used for writing the result (applicable in WRITE mode).
| nodeProjection                                              | Map or List | null                   | yes      | The node projection used for implicit graph loading or filtering nodes of an explicitly loaded graph.
| relationshipProjection                                      | Map or List | null                   | yes      | The relationship projection used for implicit graph loading or filtering relationship of an explicitly loaded graph.
| nodeQuery                                                   | String      | null                   | yes      | The Cypher query used to select the nodes for implicit graph loading via a Cypher projection.
| relationshipQuery                                           | String      | null                   | yes      | The Cypher query used to select the relationships for implicit graph loading via a Cypher projection.
| nodeProperties                                              | Map or List | null                   | yes      | The node properties to load during implicit graph loading.
| relationshipProperties                                      | Map or List | null                   | yes      | The relationship properties to load during implicit graph loading.

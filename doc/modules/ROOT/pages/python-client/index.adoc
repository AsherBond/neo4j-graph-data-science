:description: This chapter documents how to use the dedicated Python Client for Neo4j Graph Data Science.


To help users of GDS who work with Python as their primary language and environment, there is an official GDS client package called `graphdatascience`.
It enables users to write pure Python code to project graphs, run algorithms, and define and use machine learning pipelines in GDS.
To avoid naming confusion with the server-side GDS library, we will here refer to the Neo4j Graph Data Science client as the _Python client_.

The Python client API is designed to mimic the GDS Cypher procedure API in Python code.
It wraps and abstracts the necessary operations of the https://neo4j.com/docs/python-manual/current/[Neo4j Python driver] to offer a simpler surface.
Except for those listed in xref::python-client/known-limitations.adoc[Known limitations], every operation of the GDS Cypher API should be represented in the Python client API.
For a high level explanation of how the Cypher API maps to the Python client API please see xref::python-client/getting-started.adoc#python-client-getting-started-mapping[Mapping between Cypher and Python].

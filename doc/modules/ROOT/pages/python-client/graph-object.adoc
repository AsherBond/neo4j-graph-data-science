= The graph object

In order to utilize most the functionality in GDS, you must first project a graph into the xref::management-ops/graph-catalog-ops.adoc[GDS Graph Catalog].
When projecting a graph with the Python client, a client-side reference to the projected graph is returned.
We call these references `Graph` objects.

Once created, the `Graph` objects can be passed as arguments to other methods in the Python client, for example for running algorithms or training machine learning models.
Additionally, the `Graph` objects have convenience methods allowing for inspection of the projected graph represented without explicitly involving the graph catalog.

== Projecting a graph object

There are several ways of projecting a graph object.
The simplest way is to do a xref::graph-project.adoc#graph-project-native-syntax[native projection]:

[source,python]
----
G, res = gds.graph.project(
    "my-graph",                 #  Graph name
    ["MyLabel", "YourLabel"],   #  Node projection
    "MY_REL_TYPE",              #  Relationship projection
    concurrency=4               #  Configuration parameters
)
----

where `G` is a `Graph` object, and `res` is a pandas `Series` containing metadata from the underlying procedure call.

Note that all projection syntax variants are supported by way of specifying a Python `dict` or `list` for the node and relationship projection arguments.
To specify configuration parameters corresponding to the keys of the procedure's `configuration` map, we give named keyword arguments, like for `concurrency=4` above.
Read more about this in xref::graph-project.adoc#graph-project-native-syntax[Syntax].

Similarly to Cypher there's also a corresponding `gds.graph.project.estimate` method that can be called in an analogous way.

To get a graph object that represents a graph that has already been projected into the graph catalog, one can call the client-side only `get` method and passing it a name:

[source,python]
----
G = gds.graph.get("my-graph")
----

In addition to those aforementioned there are three more methods that create graph objects:

* `gds.graph.project.cypher`
* `gds.beta.graph.subgraph`
* `gds.beta.graph.generate`

Their Cypher signatures map to Python in much the same way as `gds.graph.project` above.

== Constructing a graph

Instead of projecting a graph from the Neo4j database it is also possible to construct new graphs using pandas `DataFrames` from the client.

[source,python]
----
nodes = pandas.DataFrame(
    {
        "nodeId": [0, 1, 2, 3],
        "labels":  ["A", "B", "C", "A"],
        "prop1": [42, 1337, 8, 0],
        "otherProperty": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]
    }
)

relationships = pandas.DataFrame(
    {
        "sourceNodeId": [0, 1, 2, 3],
        "targetNodeId": [1, 2, 3, 0],
        "relationshipType": ["REL", "REL", "REL", "REL"],
        "weight": [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 42.0]
    }
)

G = gds.alpha.graph.construct(
    "my-graph",      # Graph name
    nodes,           # One or more dataframes containing node data
    relationships    # One or more dataframes containing relationship data
)
----

The above example creates a simple graph using one node and one relationship `DataFrame`.
The created graph is equivalent to a graph created by the following Cypher query:

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE
    (a:A {prop1: 42,    otherProperty: 0.1),
    (b:B {prop1: 1337,  otherProperty: 0.2),
    (c:C {prop1: 8,     otherProperty: 0.3),
    (d:A {prop1: 0,     otherProperty: 0.4),
    (a)-[:REL {weight: 0.0}]->(b),
    (b)-[:REL {weight: 0.0}]->(c),
    (c)-[:REL {weight: 0.1}]->(d),
    (d)-[:REL {weight: 42.0}]->(a),
----

The supported format for the node data frames is described in xref::graph-project-apache-arrow.adoc#arrow-node-columns[Arrow node schema] and the format for the relationship data frames is described in xref::graph-project-apache-arrow.adoc#arrow-relationship-columns[Arrow relationship schema].


[.enterprise-edition]
=== Arrow flight server support

The `construct` method can utilize the xref::installation/installation-apache-arrow.adoc[Arrow Flight Server] of GDS if it's enabled.
This in particular means that:

* The construction of the graph is greatly sped up,
* It is possible to supply more than one data frame, both for nodes and relationships.
If multiple node dataframes are used, they need to contain distinct node ids across all node data frames.
* Prior to the `construct` call, a call to `GraphDataScience.set_database` must have been made to explicitly specify which Neo4j database should be targeted.


== Inspecting a graph object

There are convenience methods on the graph object that let us extract information about our projected graph.

For example, to get the node count and node properties of a graph `G`, we would do the following:

[source,python]
----
n = G.node_count()
props = G.node_properties("MyLabel")
----


== Using a graph object

The primary use case for a graph object is to pass it to algorithms.
The syntax for doing that follows the standard Cypher API, where the graph is the first parameter passed to the algorithm.

include::partial$/pythonclient/python-client-syntax.adoc[]

For example, to run the WCC on a graph `G`, and then drop the graph, do the following:

[source,python]
----
G, _ = gds.graph.project(...)

res = gds.wcc.stream(G)

gds.graph.drop(G)  # same as G.drop()
----

In most Cypher operations where a graph name is required, the graph object is used in the Python client instead.
In some cases where this does not make sense, such as for `gds.graph.exist()`, where a graph name string is used instead.

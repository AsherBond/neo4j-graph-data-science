= Neo4j Causal Cluster

A Neo4j Causal Cluster consists of multiple machines that together support a highly available database management system.
The GDS library uses main memory on a single machine for hosting graphs in the graph catalog and computing algorithms over these.
These two architectures are not compatible and should not be used in conjunction.
A GDS workload will attempt to consume most of the system resources of the machine during runtime, which may make the machine unresponsive for extended periods of time.
For these reasons, we strongly advise against running GDS in a cluster as this potentially leads to data corruption or cluster outage.

To make use of GDS on graphs hosted by a Neo4j Causal Cluster deployment, these graphs should be detached from the running cluster.
This can be accomplished in several ways, including:

1. Dumping a snapshot of the Neo4j store and importing it in a separate standalone Neo4j server.
2. Adding a Read Replica to the Neo4j Causal Cluster and then detaching it to safely operate GDS on a snapshot in separation from the Neo4j Causal Cluster.
3. Adding a Read Replica to the Neo4j Causal Cluster and configuring it for GDS workloads.
Be aware that the in-memory graph and the underlying database will eventually become out of sync due to updates to the Read Replica.
Since GDS can consume all available resources, responsiveness of the Read Replica might decrease and its state might fall behind the cluster.
Using GDS in this scenario requires:
** installing GDS on the Read Replica
** using mutate or stream invocation modes
** consuming results from GDS workloads directly via Cypher (see xref::graph-catalog-node-ops.adoc#utility-functions-catalog[Utility functions])
** *not using GDS write-back features* (writing triggers many large transactions and will potentially terminate the cluster)

After the GDS workload has finished on a detached machine (for cases 1. and 2.) it now contains out-of-sync results written to its copied version of the graph from the Neo4j Causal Cluster.
To integrate these results back to the cluster, custom programs are necessary.

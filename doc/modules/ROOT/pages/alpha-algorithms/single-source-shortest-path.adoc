= Single Source Shortest Path
:description: This section describes the Single Source Shortest Path algorithm in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library. 

The Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP) algorithm calculates the shortest (weighted) path from a node to all other nodes in the graph.

[[algorithms-single-source-shortest-path-context]]
== History and explanation

SSSP came into prominence at the same time as the shortest path algorithm and Dijkstra's algorithm can act as an implementation for both problems.

We implement a delta-stepping algorithm that has been https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.02113v1.pdf[shown to outperform Dijkstra's^].


[[algorithms-single-source-shortest-path-usecase]]
== Use-cases - when to use the Single Source Shortest Path algorithm

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Shortest_Path_First[Open Shortest Path First^] is a routing protocol for IP networks.
It uses Dijkstra's algorithm to help detect changes in topology, such as link failures, and https://routing-bits.com/2009/08/06/ospf-convergence/[come up with a new routing structure in seconds^].


[[algorithms-single-source-shortest-path-limitations]]
== Constraints - when not to use the Single Source Shortest Path algorithm

Delta stepping does not support negative weights.
The algorithm assumes that adding a relationship to a path can never make a path shorter - an invariant that would be violated with negative weights.

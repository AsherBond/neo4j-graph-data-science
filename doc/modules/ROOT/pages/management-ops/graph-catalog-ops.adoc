:description: This section details the graph catalog operations available to manage named graph projections within the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.


Graph algorithms run on a graph data model which is a _projection_ of the Neo4j property graph data model.
A graph projection can be seen as a materialized view of the graph stored in a Neo4j database, containing only analytically relevant, potentially aggregated, topological and property information.
Graph projections are stored entirely in-memory using compressed data structures optimized for topology and property lookup operations.

The graph catalog is a concept within the GDS library that allows managing multiple graph projections by name.
Using its name, a graph projection can be used many times in the analytical workflow.

After usage, named graphs can be removed from the catalog to free up main memory.
This chapter details all available graph catalog operations.


== Considerations


=== Lifecycle


[NOTE]
====
The graph catalog exists as long as the Neo4j instance is running.
When Neo4j is restarted, graphs stored in the catalog are lost.
See xref:management-ops/backup-restore.adoc[] to learn how to persist your graph projections.

=== Security

Projecting, using, listing, and dropping named graphs are management operations bound to a specific database user.
Graphs projected by a different database user are not accessible at any time, except for administrator users.
Read more about that in xref:management-ops/administration.adoc[].


== Graph projections

Named graphs can be projected from a Neo4j database by using either of

- a xref:management-ops/projections/graph-project.adoc[Native projection]
- a xref:management-ops/projections/graph-project-cypher-projection.adoc[Cypher projection]
- or a xref:management-ops/projections/graph-project-cypher-legacy.adoc[Legacy Cypher projection]

But graphs can also be projected into the graph catalog from other sources.
xref:management-ops/projections/graph-project-subgraph.adoc[Subgraph] and xref:management-ops/projections/rwr.adoc[Graph Sampling] projections allow projecting a new graph based off of an existing graph projection.
xref:management-ops/projections/graph-generation.adoc[Randomised graphs can be generated], and graphs can be xref:graph-catalog-apache-arrow-ops.adoc[constructed from external data via an Apache Arrow connection].

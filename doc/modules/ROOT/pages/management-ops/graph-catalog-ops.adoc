:description: This section details the graph catalog operations available to manage named graph projections within the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.


Graph algorithms run on a graph data model which is a _projection_ of the Neo4j property graph data model.
A graph projection can be seen as a materialized view over the stored graph, containing only analytically relevant, potentially aggregated, topological and property information.
Graph projections are stored entirely in-memory using compressed data structures optimized for topology and property lookup operations.

The graph catalog is a concept within the GDS library that allows managing multiple graph projections by name.
Using its name, a graph projection can be used many times in the analytical workflow.
Named graphs can be projected using either a xref:management-ops/projections/graph-project.adoc[Native projection] or a xref:management-ops/projections/graph-project-cypher.adoc[Cypher projection].
After usage, named graphs can be removed from the catalog to free up main memory.

[NOTE]
====
The graph catalog exists as long as the Neo4j instance is running.
When Neo4j is restarted, graphs stored in the catalog are lost.
See xref:management-ops/backup-restore.adoc[] to learn how to persist your graph projections.

This chapter explains the available graph catalog operations.

[NOTE]
====
Projecting, using, listing, and dropping named graphs are management operations bound to a Neo4j user.
Graphs projected by a different Neo4j user are not accessible at any time.

xref::machine-learning/nodeclassification-pipelines.adoc[Node Classification Pipelines] and xref::machine-learning/linkprediction-pipelines.adoc[Link Prediction Pipelines] are trained using supervised machine learning methods.
Currently, GDS supports two such methods, namely xref::machine-learning/training-methods.adoc#machine-learning-training-methods-logistic-regression[Logistic regression] and xref::machine-learning/training-methods.adoc#machine-learning-training-methods-random-forest[Random forest].
Each of these methods have several hyperparameters that one can set to influence the training.
The objective of this page is to give a brief overview of logistic regression and random forest, as well as advice on how to tune their hyperparameters.

Configuring and training model candidates using these methods is supported for xref::machine-learning/nodeclassification-pipelines.adoc#nodeclassification-pipelines-configure-model-parameters[Node Classification] and xref::machine-learning/linkprediction-pipelines.adoc#linkprediction-configure-model-parameters[Link Prediction] pipelines.

== Logistic regression

Logistic regression is a fundamental supervised machine learning classification method.
This trains a model by minimizing a loss function which depends on a weight matrix and on the training data.
The loss can be minimized for example using gradient descent.
In GDS we use the Adam optimizer which is a gradient descent type algorithm.

The weights are in the form of a `[c,d]` sized matrix `W` and a bias vector `b` of length `c`, where `d` is the feature dimension and `c` is equal to the number of classes.
The loss function is then defined as:

`CE(softmax(Wx + b))`

where `CE` is the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_entropy#Cross-entropy_loss_function_and_logistic_regression[cross entropy loss], `softmax` is the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function[softmax function], and `x` is a feature vector training sample of length `d`.

To avoid overfitting one may also add a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics)[regularization] term to the loss.
In GDS, this we provide the option of adding `l2` regularization.


=== Tuning the hyperparameters

The parameters `maxEpochs`, `tolerance` and `patience` control for how long the training will run until termination.
These parameters give ways to limit a computational budget. In general, higher `maxEpochs` and `patience` and lower `tolerance` lead to longer training but higher quality models.
It is however well-known that restricting the computational budget can serve the purpose of regularization and mitigate overfitting.

When faced with a heavy training task, a strategy to perform hyperparameter optimization faster, is to initially use lower values for the budget related parameters while exploring better ranges for other general or algorithm specific parameters.

More precisely, `maxEpochs` is the maximum number of epochs trained until termination.
Whether the training exhausted the maximum number of epochs or converged prior is reported in the neo4j debug log.

As for `patience` and `tolerance`, the former is the maximum number of consecutive epochs that do not improve the training loss at least by a `tolerance` fraction of the current loss.
After `patience` such unproductive epochs, the training is terminated.
In our experience, reasonable values for `patience` are in the range `1` to `3`.

It is also possible, via `minEpochs`, to control a minimum number of epochs before the above termination criteria enter into play.

The training algorithm applied to the above algorithms is gradient descent.
The gradients are computed concurrently on batches of `batchSize` samples using `concurrency` many threads.
At the end of an epoch the gradients are summed and scaled before updating the weights.
Therefore `batchSize` and `concurrency` do not affect model quality, but are very useful to tune for training speed.

== Random forest

Random forest is a popular supervised machine learning method for classification (and regression) that consists of using several https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree[decision trees], and combining the trees' predictions into an overall prediction.
To train the random forest is to train each of its decision trees independently.
Each decision tree is typically trained on a slightly different part of the training set, and may look at different features for its node splits.

Random forest predictions are made by simply taking the majority votes of its decision trees.
The idea is that the difference in how each decision tree is trained will help avoid overfitting which is not uncommon when just training a single decision tree on the entire training set.

The approach of combining several predictors (in this case decision trees) is also known as _ensemble learning_, and using different parts of the training set for each predictor is often referred to as _bootstrap aggregating_ or _bagging_.

The loss used by the decision trees in GDS is the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning#Gini_impurity[Gini impurity].


=== Tuning the hyperparameters

In order to balance matters such as bias vs variance of the model, and speed vs memory consumption of the training, GDS exposes several hyperparameters that one can tune.
Each of these are described below.


==== Number of decision trees

This parameter sets the number of decision trees that will be part of the random forest.

Having a too small number of trees could mean that the model will overfit to some parts of the dataset.

A larger number of trees will in general mean that the training takes longer, and the memory consumption will be higher.


==== Max features ratio

For each node split in a decision tree, a set of features of the feature vectors are considered.
The number of such features considered is the `maxFeaturesRatio` multiplied by the total number of features.
If the number of features to be considered are fewer than the total number of features, a subset of all features are sampled (without replacement).
This is sometimes referred to as _feature bagging_.

A high (close to 1.0) max features ratio means that the training will take longer as there are more options for how to split nodes in the decision trees.
It will also mean that each decision tree will be better at predictions over the training set.
While this is positive in some sense, it might also mean that each decision tree will overfit on the training set.


==== Max depth

This parameter sets the maximum depth of the decision trees in the random forest.

A high maximum depth means that the training might take longer, as more node splits might need to be considered.
The memory footprint of the produced prediction model might also be higher since the trees simply may be larger (deeper).

A deeper decision tree may be able to better fit to the training set, but that may also mean that it overfits.


==== Min split size

This parameter sets the minimum number of training samples required to be present in a node of a decision tree in order for it to be split during training.
To split a node means to continue the tree construction process to add further children below the node.

A large split size means less specialization on the training set, and thus possibly worse performance on the training set, but possibly avoiding overfitting.
It will likely also mean that the training will be faster as probably fewer node splits will be considered.


==== Number of samples ratio

Each decision tree in the random forest is trained using a subset of the training set.
This subset is sampled with replacement, meaning that a feature vector of the training may be sampled several times for a single decision tree.
The number of training samples for each decision tree is the `numberOfSamplesRatio` multiplied by the total number of samples in the training set.

A high ratio will likely imply better generalization for each decision tree, but not necessarily so for the random forest overall.
Training will also take longer as more feature vectors will need to be considered in each node split of each decision tree.

The special value of 0.0 is used to indicate no sampling.
In this case all feature vectors of the training set will be used for training by every decision tree in the random forest.

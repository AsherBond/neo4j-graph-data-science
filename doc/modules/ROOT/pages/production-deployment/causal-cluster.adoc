It is possible to run GDS as part of Neo4j Causal Cluster deployment.
Since GDS performs large computations with the full resources of the system it is not suitable to run as part of the cluster's core.
We make use of a _Read Replica_ instance to deploy the GDS library and process analytical workloads.
Calls to GDS `write` procedures are internally directed to the cluster `LEADER` instance via _server-side routing_.


== Deployment

* The cluster must contain at least one _Read Replica_ instance
** single _Core member_ and a _Read Replica_ is a valid scenario.
** GDS workloads are not load-balanced if there are more than one _Read Replica_ instances.
* Cluster should be configured to use _server-side routing_.
* GDS plugin deployed on the _Read Replica_.
** A valid GDS Enterprise Edition license must be installed and configured on the _Read Replica_.
** The driver connection to operated GDS should be made using the `bolt://` protocol, or _server-policy routed_ to the _Read Replica_ instance.

[NOTE]
====
When working with cluster configuration you should beware https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/reference/configuration-settings/#config_dbms.config.strict_validation[strict config validation] in Neo4j.

When configuring GDS for a Read Replica you will introduce GDS-specific configuration into `neo4j.conf` - and that is fine because with the GDS plugin installed, Neo4j will happily validate those configuration items.

However, you might not be able to reuse that same configuration file verbatim on the core cluster members, because there you will _not_ install GDS plugin, and thus Neo4j will _not_ be able to validate the GDS-specific configuration items. And validation failure would mean Neo4j would refuse to start.

It is of course also possible to turn strict validation off.

== GDS Configuration

The following optional settings can be used to control transaction size.

[opts="header"]
|===
| Property                  | Default
| `gds.cluster.tx.min.size` | 10000
| `gds.cluster.tx.max.size` | 100000
|===

The batch size for writing node properties is computed using both values along with the configured concurrency and total node count.
The batch size for writing relationship is using the lower value of the two settings.
There are some procedures that support batch size configuration which takes precedence if present in procedure call parameters.

= Cypher API

The Cypher API for Aura Graph Analytics matches the GDS plugin API as closely as possible.
Except for some <<limitations, limitations>>, you can adapt most of the examples from the rest of the documentation.

[[aura-api-auth]]
== Authentication to the Aura API

One key difference with the GDS plugin is the requirement to authenticate to the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/api/authentication/[Aura API] using the `gds.aura.api.credentials()` function **in each Cypher query**.

.Use of `gds.aura.api.credentials`
[source, cypher]
----
WITH gds.aura.api.credentials($clientId, $clientSecret) AS credentials // <1>
MATCH (source)
OPTIONAL MATCH (source)-->(target)
RETURN gds.graph.project('g',
  source,
  target,
  {},
  { memory: '4GB' }
)
----
<1> You can use any alias, provided that you specify one.

The function does not return any value, but registers the credentials in the query context.
The credentials are not persisted anywhere and are immediately discarded after the query has completed.

Once you have created a graph within a session, a query like the following will fail with an error indicating the missing call to `gds.aura.api.credentials()`.

.Call an algorithm procedure without Aura API credentials
[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.wcc.stream('g') // This alone will not work
----

=== Syntax

[source, cypher]
----
RETURN gds.aura.api.credentials(
  clientId: String,
  clientSecret: String
) AS credentials
----

.Configuration
[opts="header",cols="3,2,3m,2,8"]
|===
| Name         | Type   | Default | Optional | Description
| clientId     | String | n/a     | no       | The Client ID for an Aura API key pair.
| clientSecret | String | n/a     | no       | The Client Secret for an Aura API key pair.
|===

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description
| -    | -    | Always returns `null`.
|===

== Projecting a graph

[IMPORTANT]
====
Native projections and legacy Cypher projections are not supported in Aura Graph Analytics.
====

Use a xref:management-ops/graph-creation/graph-project-cypher-projection.adoc[Cypher projection] with the additional authentication clause to project a graph into a GDS Session.

Make sure to include the additional parameters with the `Aura Graph Analytics` label to create a session at the same time.

.Project a graph into a new GDS Session
[source, cypher]
----
CYPHER runtime=parallel // <1>
WITH gds.aura.api.credentials($clientId, $clientSecret) AS credentials
MATCH (source)
OPTIONAL MATCH (source)-->(target)
RETURN gds.graph.project('g', 
  source,
  target,
  {},
  { memory: '4GB' } // <2>
)
----
<1> The Cypher `parallel` runtime is recommended but not mandatory.
<2> Map containing session-related parameters such as `memory` (mandatory).

If you have created a session <<session-create-procedure, explicitly>>, add the session ID as the `sessionId` parameter to use that session instead.

.Project a graph into an existing GDS Session
[source, cypher]
----
CYPHER runtime=parallel // <1>
WITH gds.aura.api.credentials($clientId, $clientSecret) AS credentials
MATCH (source)
OPTIONAL MATCH (source)-->(target)
RETURN gds.graph.project('g',
  source,
  target,
  {},
  { sessionId: '00000000-11111111' }
)
----
<1> The Cypher `parallel` runtime is recommended but not mandatory.

== Running algorithms

[IMPORTANT]
====
See the <<limitations>> section for the list of unsupported algorithms.
====

The Cypher API for Aura Graph Analytics supports most algorithms and machine learning operations in all existing execution modes.
The syntax is the same as for the GDS plugin, with the additional authentication clause.

.Call an algorithm procedure in `stream` mode
[source, cypher]
----
WITH gds.aura.api.credentials($clientId, $clientSecret) AS credentials
CALL gds.pageRank.stream('g')
YIELD nodeId, score // <1>
RETURN *
----
<1> Due to the authentication requirement, you must always add a `YIELD` clause.
See link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/clauses/call/#call-procedure-yield[the Cypher manual] for additional details.

[[session-management]]
== Session management

The session management procedures allow to explicitly create new sessions without any attached graphs, or to list and delete existing sessions.

[[session-create-procedure]]
=== Creating sessions

Calling the `gds.session.getOrCreate` procedure triggers the creation of a GDS Session based on the specified procedure parameters.
If a session with the given name and configuration already exists, that session is returned instead.

.Create an empty GDS Session
[source, cypher]
----
WITH gds.aura.api.credentials($clientId, $clientSecret) AS credentials
CALL gds.session.getOrCreate(
  'test-session',
  '4GB',
  duration({minutes: 5})
)
YIELD id AS sessionId, name AS sessionName
RETURN sessionId, sessionName
----

When you create a session explicitly with `gds.session.getOrCreate`, note down the `sessionId` and set it as a xref:management-ops/graph-creation/graph-project-cypher-projection.adoc#graph-project-cypher-projection-syntax-configuration[configuration parameter] for the `gds.graph.project` procedure when you project a new graph.

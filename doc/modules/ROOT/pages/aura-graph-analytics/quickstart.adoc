= Quickstart

Here is a full example of how to use the Cypher API to load data from an AuraDB instance into a remote session, run two algorithms, then write the results back to AuraDB.

You can find more details on each step and procedure in the xref:aura-graph-analytics/cypher.adoc[] page.

== Projecting a graph

Start by adding some example data into the AuraDB database.

.Create an example graph in the Neo4j database
[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE
  (a:User {name: 'Alice', age: 23}),
  (b:User {name: 'Bridget', age: 34}),
  (c:User {name: 'Charles', age: 45}),
  (d:User {name: 'Dana', age: 56}),
  (e:User {name: 'Eve', age: 67}),
  (f:User {name: 'Fawad', age: 78}),

  (a)-[:LINK {weight: 0.5}]->(b),
  (b)-[:LINK {weight: 0.2}]->(a),
  (a)-[:LINK {weight: 4}]->(c),
  (c)-[:LINK {weight: 2}]->(e),
  (e)-[:LINK {weight: 1.1}]->(d),
  (e)-[:LINK {weight: -2}]->(f);

The next step is to project the data into a graph within a remote session.
The following example shows how to run a Cypher projection and xref:aura-graph-analytics/index.adoc#implicit-sessions[create a session] at the same time.

[IMPORTANT]
Make sure that the credentials you use here are the Aura API keys (client ID and client secret), *not* your AuraDB credentials (username and password).

.Project a graph called 'myGraph' using a remote Cypher projection into a new GDS Session
[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CYPHER runtime=parallel // <1>
WITH gds.aura.api.credentials($clientId, $clientSecret) AS credentials // <2>
MATCH (source:User)
OPTIONAL MATCH (source)-[r:LINK]->(target:User)
WITH gds.graph.project('myGraph', source, target, {
  sourceNodeProperties: source { .age },
  targetNodeProperties: target { .age },
  relationshipProperties: r { .weight }
}, {
  memory: '4GB', ttl: duration({minutes: 5}) // <3>
}) AS g
RETURN g.graphName, g.nodeCount, g.relationshipCount
----
<1> The Cypher `parallel` runtime is recommended but not mandatory.
<2> Add the `gds.aura.api.credentials` function before the actual query.
You need to set the `clientId` and `clientSecret` link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/syntax/parameters/[query parameters] first.
<3> Set the `memory` (mandatory) and `ttl` (optional) parameters.

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| graphName | nodeCount | relationshipCount
| "myGraph" | 6         | 6
|===

After this completes, the session is ready to use.
If you have the Aura Console open, you can see the session listed in the *Graph Analytics* view.

You can also get details on the projected graph using the `gds.graph.list()` procedure.

[role=query-example]
--
.Get details of the projected graph
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
WITH gds.aura.api.credentials($clientId, $clientSecret) AS credentials
CALL gds.graph.list()
YIELD graphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount
RETURN graphName, nodeCount, relationshipCount
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| graphName | nodeCount | relationshipCount
| "myGraph"  | 6         | 6
|===
--


== Running algorithms

Run the xref:algorithms/page-rank.adoc[] algorithm in `mutate` mode on the remote graph to create the `pageRank` node property from its results.

[role=query-example]
--
.Run the PageRank algorithm in `mutate` mode
[source, cypher]
----
WITH gds.aura.api.credentials($clientId, $clientSecret) AS credentials
CALL gds.pageRank.mutate('myGraph', { mutateProperty: 'pageRank' })
YIELD ranIterations, nodePropertiesWritten
RETURN ranIterations, nodePropertiesWritten
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| ranIterations | nodePropertiesWritten
| 1             | 6
|===
--

Use the new `pageRank` node property as input to the xref:machine-learning/node-embeddings/fastrp.adoc[FastRP algorithm] and create the `fastrp` node property.

[role=query-example]
--
.Run the FastRP algorithm in `mutate` mode
[source, cypher]
----
WITH gds.aura.api.credentials($clientId, $clientSecret) AS credentials
CALL gds.fastRP.mutate('myGraph', {
  featureProperties: ['pageRank'],
  relationshipWeightProperty: 'weight',
  iterationWeights: [1, 1, 1],
  randomSeed: 42,
  embeddingDimension: 8,
  mutateProperty: 'fastrp'
})
YIELD nodePropertiesWritten
RETURN nodePropertiesWritten
----

Inspect the values of the new node properties.

.Stream node properties
[source, cypher]
----
WITH gds.aura.api.credentials($clientId, $clientSecret) AS credentials
CALL gds.graph.nodeProperty.stream('myGraph', 'fastrp')
YIELD nodeId, propertyValue
RETURN nodeId, propertyValue
ORDER BY nodeId
----

| 5      | [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
|===

== Writing results to the database

You can write new properties to the source AuraDB database in two ways:

* Using the `gds.graph.nodeProperty.write()` procedure (see xref:management-ops/graph-write-to-neo4j/write-back-to-nodes.adoc[] for more details).
+
[role=query-example]
--
.Write the `fastrp` property
[source, cypher]
----
WITH gds.aura.api.credentials($clientId, $clientSecret) AS credentials
CALL gds.graph.nodeProperties.write('myGraph', ['fastrp'])
YIELD propertiesWritten
RETURN propertiesWritten
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| propertiesWritten
| 6
|===
--

* Running an algorithm in `write` mode.
+
[role=query-example]
--
.Run the Louvain algorithm in `write` mode
[source, cypher]
----
WITH gds.aura.api.credentials($clientId, $clientSecret) AS credentials
CALL gds.louvain.write('myGraph', { writeProperty: 'louvain' })
YIELD communityCount, modularity
RETURN communityCount, modularity
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| communityCount | modularity
| 2              | 0.3333333333333333
|===
--

== Cleaning up

When you do not need to run any more algorithms, drop the projected graph.
Since the session was created xref:aura-graph-analytics/index.adoc#implicit-sessions[implicitly] (together with the graph), dropping the graph will also delete the session and tear down its corresponding Aura instance.

[role=cleanup-query]
--
.Drop the graph 'myGraph'
[source, cypher]
----
WITH gds.aura.api.credentials($clientId, $clientSecret) AS credentials
CALL gds.graph.drop('myGraph')
YIELD graphName
RETURN graphName
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| graphName
| "myGraph"
|===
--

After this completes, the session is no longer visible in the Aura Console and no more costs are incurred for its use.

If you do not explicitly drop the graph, the session will automatically expire after the configured `ttl` time has passed.

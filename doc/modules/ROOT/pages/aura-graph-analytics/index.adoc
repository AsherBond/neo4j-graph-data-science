Aura Graph Analytics is an on-demand ephemeral compute environment for running graph data science workloads.

Aura Graph Analytics is based on _sessions_.
Each session is a standalone link:https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/graph-analytics/#aura-gds-serverless[Neo4j Aura compute environment] that is created when needed and deleted when no longer usefulfootnote:[Or when the <<max-lifetime, maximum session lifetime>> is reached.], all without any instance management operations.
You only need to have link:https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/api/authentication/[Aura API credentials] ready before you can start using sessions.

Depending on where your data is, you can use three types of session:

* *Attached*: when the data source is a Neo4j AuraDB instance.
* *Self-managed*: when the data source is a self-managed Neo4j DBMS.
* *Standalone*: when the data source is not based on Neo4j.

== Workflow

The typical workflow with Aura Graph Analytics is:

. Create a session.
. Load your data into a session via a _remote projection_ (similar to a standard xref:management-ops/graph-creation/graph-project-cypher-projection.adoc[Cypher projection]).
. Run graph algorithms or train machine learning models on the data.
. Write the results back to the original data source using _remote write-back_ (for attached and self-managed sessions) or a custom method (for standalone sessions).
. Delete the session.

You can create and use sessions with the Cypher API (a collection of Cypher procedures shown in the xref:aura-graph-analytics/quickstart.adoc[] and, more in detail, in the xref:aura-graph-analytics/cypher.adoc[] page) or with the Python client (see the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science-client/current/graph-analytics-serverless/[overview] and the tutorials on link:https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science-client/current/tutorials/graph-analytics-serverless/[attached], link:https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science-client/current/tutorials/graph-analytics-serverless-self-managed/[self-managed], and link:https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science-client/current/tutorials/graph-analytics-serverless-standalone/[standalone] sessions).

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Cypher API is available only for sessions attached to AuraDB instances in the Professional, Business Critical, or Virtual Dedicated Cloud plans.
Depending on which plan is used, different limitations apply.
See link:https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/graph-analytics/#_comparison[Graph analytics in Aura] for a comparison.

[[implicit-sessions]]
=== Implicit sessions

If you use the Cypher API, you can skip the first and last step by creating a session automatically with the first remote projection.

In this case, the session is deleted when the projected graph is dropped.
If additional graphs are projected into the same session, for example via xref:management-ops/graph-creation/graph-filter.adoc[graph filtering], the session is deleted only after all graphs are dropped.

Implicit sessions can still be listed and dropped via the corresponding xref:aura-graph-analytics/cypher.adoc#session-management[session management procedures].

== Configuration

[[session-size]]
=== Session size

When creating a session (either explicitly or via a remote graph projection), you must set the `memory` parameter to specify the maximum amount of memory allocated to the process.
A larger size means faster runtime and the ability to process larger volumes of data, but also increased link:https://neo4j.com/pricing/#graph-analytics[cost].

The supported values are `2GB`, `4GB`, `8GB`, `16GB`, `24GB`, `32GB`, `48GB`, `64GB`, `96GB`, `128GB`, `192GB`, `256GB`, `384GB`, and `512GB`.

[NOTE]
The session maximum size can be configured for your whole Aura organization.
Check with your organization administrator what your maximum size is.

[[session-expiration]]
=== Session expiration

When creating a session (either explicitly or via a remote graph projection), you can set an optional `ttl` parameter to specify how quickly an inactive session will expire.
The default value for `ttl` is 1 hour and the maximum allowed value is {max-lifetime}.

An expired session cannot be used to run workloads, does not incur any cost, and will be deleted automatically after {max-lifetime}.
It can also be deleted through the Aura Console UI.

[[max-lifetime]]
==== Maximum lifetime

A session can never be kept active for more than {max-lifetime}.
Even if the session does not expire due to inactivity, it will still expire {max-lifetime} after its creation.
This is a hard limit and cannot be changed.

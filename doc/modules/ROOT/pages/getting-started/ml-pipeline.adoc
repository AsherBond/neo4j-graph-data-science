:description: This chapter shows a complete example using machine learning pipelines from the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.
:keywords: GDS, getting started, machine learning, pipeline

This example is a simplified version of the Link Prediction pipeline described in the xref:machine-learning/linkprediction-pipelines/config.adoc[Machine learning] section.


== Create the graph

The following Cypher query creates the graph of a small social network in the Neo4j database.

----
CREATE
  (alice:Person {name: 'Alice', age: 38}),
  (michael:Person {name: 'Michael', age: 67}),
  (karin:Person {name: 'Karin', age: 30}),
  (chris:Person {name: 'Chris', age: 52}),
  (will:Person {name: 'Will', age: 6}),
  (mark:Person {name: 'Mark', age: 32}),
  (greg:Person {name: 'Greg', age: 29}),
  (veselin:Person {name: 'Veselin', age: 3}),

  (alice)-[:KNOWS]->(michael),
  (michael)-[:KNOWS]->(karin),
  (michael)-[:KNOWS]->(chris),
  (michael)-[:KNOWS]->(greg),
  (will)-[:KNOWS]->(michael),
  (will)-[:KNOWS]->(chris),
  (mark)-[:KNOWS]->(michael),
  (mark)-[:KNOWS]->(will),
  (greg)-[:KNOWS]->(chris),
  (veselin)-[:KNOWS]->(chris),
  (karin)-[:KNOWS]->(veselin),
  (chris)-[:KNOWS]->(karin)
----

The graph looks as follows:

image::lp-graph.svg["LP example data."]

The next query creates an in-memory graph called `friends` from the Neo4j graph.
Since the Link Prediction model requires the graph to be undirected, the orientation of the `:KNOWS` relationship is discarded.

----
CALL gds.graph.project(
  'friends',
  {
    Person: {
      properties: ['age']
    }
  },
  {
    KNOWS: {
      orientation: 'UNDIRECTED'
    }
  }
)
----


== Configure the pipeline

You can configure a machine learning pipeline with a sequence of Cypher queries.

[NOTE]
====
The following configuration is simplified for convenience.
As such, the model performance is not expected to be the best.
====

[role=query-example]
--
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.beta.pipeline.linkPrediction.create('pipe');  // <1>

CALL gds.beta.pipeline.linkPrediction.addFeature(  // <2>
  'pipe', 
  'cosine',
  {
    nodeProperties: ['age']
  }
);

CALL gds.beta.pipeline.linkPrediction.configureSplit(  // <3>
  'pipe',
  {
    testFraction: 0.25,
    trainFraction: 0.6,
    validationFolds: 3
  }
);

CALL gds.beta.pipeline.linkPrediction.addLogisticRegression('pipe');  // <4>
----
<1> Create the pipeline and add it to the pipeline catalog.
<2> Add the xref:machine-learning/linkprediction-pipelines/config.adoc#linkprediction-adding-features[link features] (only `age` here) and a feature type (`cosine` here).
<3> Configure the xref:machine-learning/linkprediction-pipelines/config.adoc#linkprediction-configure-splits[train-test split] and the number of folds for cross-validation.
<4> Add a xref:machine-learning/linkprediction-pipelines/config.adoc#linkprediction-adding-model-candidates[model candidate] (a logistic regression with no further configuration here).
--


== Train a model

Once configured, the pipeline is ready to train a model.
The training process returns the best performing model with the specified evaluation metrics.

[role=query-example]
--
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.beta.pipeline.linkPrediction.train(
  'friends',  // <1>
  {
    pipeline: 'pipe',  // <2>
    modelName: 'lp-pipeline-model',  // <3>
    targetRelationshipType: 'KNOWS',  // <4>
    metrics: ['AUCPR'],  // <5>
  }
)
YIELD modelInfo
RETURN
  modelInfo.bestParameters AS winningModel,  // <6>
  modelInfo.metrics.AUCPR.train.avg AS avgTrainScore,  // <7>
  modelInfo.metrics.AUCPR.validation.avg AS avgValidationScore,
  modelInfo.metrics.AUCPR.outerTrain AS outerTrainScore,
  modelInfo.metrics.AUCPR.test AS testScore
----
<1> Name of the projected graph to use for training.
<2> Name of the configured pipeline.
<3> Name of the model to train.
<4> Name of the relationship to train the model on.
<5> Metrics used to evaluate the models (`AUCPR` here).
<6> Parameters of the best performing model returned by the training process.
<7> Evaluated metrics (here for `AUCPR`) of the best performing model returned by the training process.
--


== Use the model for prediction

You can use the trained model to predict the probability that a link exists between two nodes in a projected graph.

[role=query-example]
--
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.beta.pipeline.linkPrediction.predict.stream(  // <1>
  'friends',  // <2>
  {
    modelName: 'lp-pipeline-model',  // <3>
    topN: 5  // <4>
  }
)
YIELD node1, node2, probability
RETURN
  gds.util.asNode(node1).name AS person1,
  gds.util.asNode(node2).name AS person2,
  probability
ORDER BY probability DESC, person1
----
<1> Run the prediction in `stream` mode (return the predicted links as query results).
<2> Name of the projected graph to run the prediction on.
<3> Name of the model to use for prediction.
<4> Maximum number of predicted relationships to output.
--


== Next steps

Try to improve the performance of the training by using different model candidates, adding xref:machine-learning/linkprediction-pipelines/config.adoc#linkprediction-adding-node-properties[node properties] to the features, or configuring xref:machine-learning/linkprediction-pipelines/config.adoc#linkprediction-configure-auto-tuning[autotuning].

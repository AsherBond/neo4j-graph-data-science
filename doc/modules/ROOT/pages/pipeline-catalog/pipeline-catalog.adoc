:description: This section details the pipeline catalog operations available to manage named training pipelines within the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.


In GDS, we have machine learning pipelines which offer an end-to-end workflow, from graph feature extraction to model training.
This includes the following:

* xref::machine-learning/node-property-prediction/nodeclassification-pipelines/node-classification.adoc[Node Classification pipelines]
* xref::machine-learning/linkprediction-pipelines/link-prediction.adoc[Link Prediction pipelines]

The pipeline catalog is a concept within the GDS library that allows managing multiple training pipelines by name.

This chapter explains the available pipeline catalog operations.

= Pre-processing

In most machine learning scenarios, several pre-processing steps are applied to produce data that is amenable to machine learning algorithms.
This is also true for graph data.
The goal of pre-processing is to provide good features for the learning algorithm.
In GDS some options include:

* xref::algorithms/node-embeddings.adoc[Node embeddings]
* xref::algorithms/centrality.adoc[Centrality algorithms]
* xref::algorithms/auxiliary.adoc[Auxiliary algorithms]
** Of special interest are xref::alpha-algorithms/scale-properties.adoc[Scale Properties] and
** xref::alpha-algorithms/split-relationships.adoc[Split Relationships] for xref::algorithms/ml-models/linkprediction.adoc[Link Prediction].

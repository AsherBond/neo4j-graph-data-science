= Machine learning models
:description: This chapter provides explanations and examples for the supervised machine learning models in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library. 

The machine learning procedures in Neo4j GDS allow you to train supervised machine learning models.
Models can then be accessed via the xref::model-catalog/index.adoc[Model catalog] and used to make predictions about your graph.

To help with working with the ML models, there are additional guides for pre-processing and hyperparameter tuning available in:

* xref::algorithms/ml-models/pre-processing.adoc[Pre-processing]
* xref::algorithms/ml-models/models-tuning.adoc[Tuning parameters for training]

The Neo4j GDS library includes the following machine learning models, grouped by quality tier:

* Alpha
** xref::algorithms/ml-models/node-classification.adoc[Node Classification]
** xref::algorithms/ml-models/nodeclassification-pipelines.adoc[Node Classification Pipelines]
** xref::algorithms/ml-models/linkprediction.adoc[Link Prediction]
** xref::algorithms/ml-models/linkprediction-pipelines.adoc[Link Prediction Pipelines]

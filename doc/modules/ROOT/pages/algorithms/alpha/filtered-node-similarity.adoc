[[algorithms-filtered-node-similarity-intro]]
== Introduction

The Filtered Node Similarity algorithm is an extension to the xref::algorithms/node-similarity.adoc[Node Similarity] algorithm.
It adds support for filtering on source nodes, target nodes, or both.

Filtered Node Similarity is under it's own namespace because the node filtering behavior is in alpha tier.
For information about algorithm tiers, see xref::algorithms/index.adoc#algorithms-tiers[Algorithm tiers].


[[algorithms-filtered-node-similarity-node-filtering]]
== Node filtering

A node filter reduces the node space for which the algorithm will produce results.
Consider two similarity results: _A_ = `(alice)-[:SIMILAR_TO]->(bob)` and _B_ `(bob)-[:SIMILAR_TO]->(alice)`.
Result A will be produced if the `(alice)` node matches the source node filter and the `(bob)` node matches the target node filter
If the `(alice)` node does not match the target node filter, or the `(bob)` node does not match the source node filter, result *B* will not be produce.


[[algorithms-filtered-node-similarity-filter-configuration]]
== Configuring node filters

For the standard configuration of node similarity, see xref::algorithms/node-similarity.adoc#algorithms-node-similarity-syntax[Node Similarity syntax].

The source node filter is specified with the `sourceNodeFilter` configuration parameter.
The target node filter is specified with the `targetNodeFilter` configuration parameter.
Neither parameter is mandatory.

The node filter parameters accept one of the following:

.Syntax for `sourceNodeFilter` and `targetNodeFilter`
[cols="1,2a"]
|===
| a single node id
| `sourceNodeFilter: 42`
| a list of node ids
| `sourceNodeFilter: [23, 42, 87]`
| a single node
| `MATCH (person:Person) WITH person ORDER BY person.age DESC LIMIT 1` ... `sourceNodeFilter: n`
| a list of nodes
| `MATCH (person:Person) WHERE person.age > 35 collect(person) AS people` ... `sourceNodeFilter: people`
| a single label
| `sourceNodeFilter: 'Person'`
|===

:description: This chapter provides explanations and examples for each of the similarity algorithms in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.


Similarity algorithms compute the similarity of pairs of nodes using different vector-based metrics.
The Neo4j GDS library includes the following similarity algorithms, grouped by quality tier:

* Production-quality
** xref::algorithms/node-similarity.adoc[Node Similarity]
* Beta
** xref::algorithms/knn.adoc[K-Nearest Neighbors]
* Alpha
** xref::alpha-algorithms/approximate-nearest-neighbors.adoc[Approximate Nearest Neighbors]
** xref::alpha-algorithms/cosine.adoc[Cosine Similarity]
** xref::alpha-algorithms/euclidean.adoc[Euclidean Similarity]
** xref::alpha-algorithms/jaccard.adoc[Jaccard Similarity]
** xref::alpha-algorithms/overlap.adoc[Overlap Similarity]

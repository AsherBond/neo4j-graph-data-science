== Introduction

A spanning tree is a graph such that there is exactly one path between any two nodes in the set.
A graph can have many possible spanning tree subsets depending on the set of nodes/relationships selected.

Given a weighted graph where each node has a prize, the Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree problem asks for the  spanning tree that  satisfies the following conditions:

- the sum of prizes for the nodes in the graph is mximized.
- the sum of weights of relationships and prizes for nodes not in the tree is minimized.

The two constraints can combined to form a single maximization problem by simpling  subtracting the second constraint for the former.

The Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree is NP-Complete and no efficient exact algorithms is known.
The Neo4j GDS Library implements a practical   https://people.csail.mit.edu/ludwigs/papers/dimacs14_fastpcst.pdf[2-approximate algorithm] from the literature.
This means that the returned answer should be at least half as good as the optimal answer.

[[algorithms-prize-steiner-tree-considerations]]
== Considerations

By default, the Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree problem considers prizes only for nodes.
In some cases, however, it can be useful to also consider prizes on relationships.
The GDS implementation can handle prizes for relationships through the following transformation:
Given a relationship with weight `w` and prize `p`,
we suggest to replace `w` with `w' = w - p`.
This should be done as a pre-processing step prior to projecting the in-memory graph.

The algorithm finds a tree cntaing A,B,C,D, and E.
The node F is skipped  because it's price is very low and connecting it with the other nodes would yield an inferior solution.

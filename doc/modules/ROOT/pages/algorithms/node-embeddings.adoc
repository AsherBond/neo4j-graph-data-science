= Node embeddings
:description: This chapter provides explanations and examples for the node embedding algorithms in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library. 

Node embedding algorithms compute low-dimensional vector representations of nodes in a graph.
These vectors, also called embeddings, can be used for machine learning.
The Neo4j Graph Data Science library contains the following node embedding algorithms:

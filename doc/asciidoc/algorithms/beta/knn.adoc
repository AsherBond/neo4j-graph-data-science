[[algorithms-knn-intro]]
== Introduction

The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm computes a distance value for all node pairs in the graph and creates new relationships between each node and its k nearest neighbors.
The distance is calculated based on node properties.

The input of this algorithm is a monopartite graph.
The graph does not need to be connected, in fact, existing relationships between nodes will be ignored.
New relationships are created between each node and its k nearest neighbors.

The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm compares a given property of each node.
The `k` nodes where this property is most similar are the k-nearest neighbors.

The initial set of neighbors is picked at random and verified and refined in multiple iterations.
The number of iterations is limited by the configuration parameter `maxIterations`.
The algorithm may stop earlier if the neighbor lists only change by a small amount, which can be controlled by the configuration parameter `deltaThreshold`.

The particular implementation is based on https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1963405.1963487[Efficient k-nearest neighbor graph construction for generic similarity measures] by Wei Dong et al.
Instead of comparing every node with every other node, the algorithm selects possible neighbors based on the assumption, that the neighbors-of-neighbors of a node are most likely already the nearest one.
The algorithm scales quasi-linear with respect to the node count, instead of being quadratic.

Furthermore, the algorithm only compares a sample of all possible neighbors on each iteration, assuming that eventually all possible neighbors will be seen.
This can be controlled with the configuration parameter `sampleRate`:

* A valid sample rate must be in between 0 (exclusive) and 1 (inclusive).
* The default value is `0.5`.
* The parameter is used to control the trade-off between accuracy and runtime-performance.
* A higher sample rate will increase the accuracy of the result.
** The algorithm will also require more memory and will take longer to compute.
* A lower sample rate will increase the runtime-performance.
** Some potential nodes may be missed in the comparison and may not be included in the result.

The output of the algorithm are new relationships between nodes and their k-nearest neighbors.
Similarity scores are expressed via relationship properties.

[[algorithms-knn-introduction-similarity]]
=== Similarity measures

The similarity measure used in the KNN algorithm depends on the type of the configured node property.
KNN supports both scalar numeric values as well as lists of numbers.

Scalar numeric property::

When the property is a scalar number, the similarity is computed as one divided by one plus the absolute difference between the values:

image::equations/knn-scalar-similarity.svg[one divided by one plus the absolute difference of ps and pt,align="center"]

List of integers::

When the property is a list of integers, the similarity is computed as one divided by  one plus the number of unequal numbers in the list:

image::equations/knn-integer-list-similarity.svg[one divided by one plus delta of ps and pt,align="center"]

List of floating-point numbers::

When the property is a list of floating-point numbers, the similarity is computed using the cosine similarity metric.
See the <<algorithms-similarity-cosine-context, Cosine Similarity>> algorithm for more details.
If the cosine similarity is negative, we clip the value to `0`, i.e., `max(cosine(a, b), 0))`.

[[algorithms-knn-examples]]
== Examples

Consider the graph created by the following Cypher statement:

[source, cypher, role=noplay setup-query]
----
CREATE (alice:Person {name: 'Alice', age: 24})
CREATE (bob:Person {name: 'Bob', age: 73})
CREATE (carol:Person {name: 'Carol', age: 24})
CREATE (dave:Person {name: 'Dave', age: 48})
CREATE (eve:Person {name: 'Eve', age: 67});
----

In the example, we want to use the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to compare people based on their age.

[NOTE]
====
In the examples below we will use named graphs and standard projections as the norm.
However, <<cypher-projection, Cypher projection>> and anonymous graphs could also be used.
====

.The following statement will create the graph and store it in the graph catalog.
[source, cypher, role=noplay graph-create-query]
----
CALL gds.graph.create(
    'myGraph',
    {
        Person: {
            label: 'Person',
            properties: 'age'
        }

We use default values for the procedure configuration parameter for most parameters.
The `randomSeed` is set to produce the same result on every invocation.
The `topK` parameter is set to 1 to only return the single nearest neighbor for every node.

    mutateProperty: 'score',

As we can see from the results, the number of created relationships is equal to the number of rows in the streaming example.


[[algorithms-knn-examples-write]]
=== Write

The `write` execution mode extends the `stats` mode with an important side effect: for each pair of nodes we create a relationship with the similarity score as a property to the Neo4j database.
The type of the new relationship is specified using the mandatory configuration parameter `writeRelationshipType`.
Each new relationship stores the similarity score between the two nodes it represents.
The relationship property key is set using the mandatory configuration parameter `writeProperty`.
The result is a single summary row, similar to `stats`, but with some additional metrics.

For more details on the `write` mode in general, see <<running-algos-write>>.


[role=query-example]

.The following will run the algorithm, and write back results:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]

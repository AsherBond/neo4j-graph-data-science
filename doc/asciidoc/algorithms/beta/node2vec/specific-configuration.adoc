| Name                                                                              | Type    | Default | Optional | Description
| walkLength                                                                        | Integer | 80      | yes      | The number of steps in a single random walk.
| walksPerNode                                                                      | Integer | 10      | yes      | The number of random walks generated for each node.
| inOutFactor                                                                       | Float   | 1.0     | yes      | Tendency of the random walk to stay close to the start node or fan out in the graph. Higher value means stay local.
| returnFactor                                                                      | Float   | 1.0     | yes      | Tendency of the random walk to return to the last visited node. A value below 1.0 means a higher tendency.
| <<common-configuration-relationship-weight-property,relationshipWeightProperty>>  | String  | null    | yes      |If set, the values stored at the given property are used as relationship weights to influence the probabilities of the random walks. The weights need to be >= 0.
| windowSize                                                                        | Integer | 10      | yes      | Size of the context window when training the neural network.
| negativeSamplingRate                                                              | Integer | 5       | yes      | Number of negative samples to produce for each positive sample.
| positiveSamplingFactor                                                            | Float   | 0.001   | yes      | Factor for influencing the distribution for positive samples. A higher value increases the probability that frequent nodes are down-sampled.
| negativeSamplingExponent                                                          | Float   | 0.75    | yes      | Exponent applied to the node frequency to obtain the negative sampling distribution. A value of 1.0 samples proportionally to the frequency. A value of 0.0 samples each node equally.
| embeddingDimension                                                                | Integer | 128     | yes      | Size of the computed node embeddings.
| iterations                                                                        | Integer | 1       | yes      | Number of training iterations.
| initialLearningRate                                                               | Float   | 0.01    | yes      | Learning rate used initially for training the neural network. The learning rate decreases after each training iteration.
| minLearningRate                                                                   | Float   | 0.0001  | yes      | Lower bound for learning rate as it is decreased during training.
| randomSeed                                                                        | Integer | random  | yes      | Seed value for the random number generator used to generate the random walks.
| walkBufferSize                                                                    | Integer | 1000    | yes      | The number of random walks to complete before starting training.

| Name                                                                             | Type          | Default   | Optional | Description
| modelName                                                                        | String        | n/a       | no       | The name of the model to train, must not exist in the Model Catalog.
| featureProperties                                                                | List<String>  | n/a       | no       | The names of the node properties that should be used as input features. All property names must exist in the in-memory graph and be of type Float or List<Float>.
| embeddingDimension                                                               | Integer       | 64        | yes      | The dimension of the generated node embeddings as well as their hidden layer representations.
| aggregator                                                                       | String        | "mean"    | yes      | The aggregator to be used by the layers. Supported values are "mean" and "pool".
| activationFunction                                                               | String        | "sigmoid" | yes      | The activation function to be used in the model architecture. Supported values are "sigmoid" and "relu".
| sampleSizes                                                                      | List<Integer> | [25, 10]  | yes      | A list of Integer values, the size of the list determines the number of layers and the values determine how many nodes will be sampled by the layers.
| projectedFeatureDimension                                                        | Integer       | n/a       | yes      | The total dimension of the projected `featureProperties`. This enables multi-label GraphSage, where each label can have a subset of the `featureProperties`.
| batchSize                                                                        | Integer       | 100       | yes      | The number of nodes per batch.
| <<common-configuration-tolerance,tolerance>>                                     | Float         | 1e-4      | yes      | Tolerance used for the early convergence inside epochs. The training will converge when the absolute loss difference between two epochs is lower than the tolerance value.
| learningRate                                                                     | Float         | 0.1       | yes      | The learning rate determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function.
| epochs                                                                           | Integer       | 1         | yes      | Number of times to traverse the graph.
| <<common-configuration-max-iterations,maxIterations>>                            | Integer       | 10        | yes      | Maximum number of weight updates per batch. Batches can also converge early based on `tolerance`.
| searchDepth                                                                      | Integer       | 5         | yes      | Maximum depth of the RandomWalks to sample neighbors for the training.
| negativeSampleWeight                                                             | Integer       | 20        | yes      | The weight of the negative samples. Higher values increase the impact of negative samples in the loss.
| <<common-configuration-relationship-weight-property,relationshipWeightProperty>> | String        | null      | yes      | If set, the values stored at the given property are used as relationship weights during the computation. If not set, the graph is considered unweighted.

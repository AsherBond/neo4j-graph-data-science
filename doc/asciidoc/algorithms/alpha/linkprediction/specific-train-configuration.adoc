| Name                | Type    | Default         | Optional | Description
| penalty             | Float   | 0.0             | yes      | Penalty used for the logistic regression. By default, no penalty is applied.
| linkFeatureCombiner | String  | "L2"            | yes      | Link feature combiner is used to combine two node feature vectors into the feature vector for the training. Available combiners are `L2`, `HADAMARD` and `COSINE`.
| batchSize           | Integer | 100             | yes      | Number of nodes per batch.
| minEpochs           | Integer | 1               | yes      | Minimum number of training epochs.
| maxEpochs           | Integer | 100             | yes      | Maximum number of training epochs.
| patience            | Integer | 1               | yes      | Maximum number of unproductive consecutive epochs.
| tolerance           | Float   | 0.001           | yes      | The minimal improvement of the loss to be considered productive.
| sharedUpdater       | Boolean | false           | yes      | Whether to use a shared ADAM optimizer across training threads.
| concurrency         | Integer | see description | yes      | Concurrency for training the model candidate. By default the value of the top level `concurrency` parameter is used.

= Removing graphs from the catalog

Once we have finished using the named graph we can remove it from the catalog to free up memory.

.Remove a graph from the catalog:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.drop('my-store-graph') YIELD graphName;
----

If we want the procedure to fail silently on non-existing graphs, we can set a boolean flag as the second parameter to false.
This will yield an empty result for non-existing graphs.

.Try removing a graph from the catalog:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.drop('my-fictive-graph', false) YIELD graphName;
----

If we want to drop a graph created on another database, we can set the database name as the third parameter.
This will yield an empty result for non-existing graphs.

.Try removing a graph from the catalog:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.drop('my-fictive-graph', false, 'my-other-db') YIELD graphName;
----

If we are a GDS administrator and want to drop a graph that belongs to another user we can set the username as the fourth parameter to the procedure.
This is useful if there are multiple users with graphs of the same name.

.Remove a graph from a specific user's graph catalog:
[source, cypher, role=noplay]
----
CALL gds.graph.drop('my-fictive-graph', false, '', 'another-user') YIELD graphName;
----

See <<administration>> for more details on this.

This section explains administration capabilities in the Neo4j Graph Data Science library.

The GDS catalog offers elevated access to administrator users.
Any user granted a role with the name `admin` is considered an administrator by GDS.

A GDS administrator has access to graphs created by any other user.
This includes the ability to list, drop and run algorithms over these graphs.


== Disambiguating identically named graphs

Sometimes, several users (including the admin user themselves) could have a graph with the same name.
To disambiguate between these graphs, the `username` configuration parameter can be used.


== Examples
